## Thanks

Charles Broskoski's Drawing project was a big inspiration â€“ [link](http://charlesbroskoski.com/drawings/).


## Implementation

The frontend uses javacript and HTML Canvas. Canvas has a native function `toDataURL()` which returns a base64-encocoded string representing the current canvas as a png. I am storing this string in my database and then streaming it back when the client requests images.

The backend is a NodeJS app. I am using Mongoose and Mongo for data modeling and storing, Express for my API, and EJS for templating. I built the app following MVC and RESTful principles.

The live site is currently served by Nginx and lives on a DigitalOcean droplet running Ubuntu. I wanted to try a manual deployment to get familiar with using a remote machine and managing an environment without much auto configuration.

## Features

Users can:
- Create an account
- Create and post drawings
- Draw on top of exisiting drawings
- Manage drawings (lock/unlock and delete)
- Log in and log out

## Goals

My goal is to allow friends to doodle together. Currently the app has one global collection, where all users drawings are posted. To better encourage an intimate, friendly feel I want to implement galleries that would act as private rooms for groups of users.
